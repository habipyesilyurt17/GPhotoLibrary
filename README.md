# Custom Gallery
- The user can view “All Photos” in the gallery.
- You can select a maximum of 20 photos. If you want to select more, you will be warned with a custom banner.
- Each selected photo has sequential numbering (1, 2, 3…) and when the photo is deselected, the numbering is updated.
- When at least 1 photo is selected, the preview area (thumbnail versions of the selected images in a sequential order) becomes active.
- We can remove the images in the preview area with the help of the cross button on them.
- When the app is first opened, the user is asked for permission to access the gallery. In the scenario where permission is not granted, a warning message appears on the screen and a button directed to Settings. After granting permission to the app from Settings, the gallery is accessed.
